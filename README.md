# 🚖 Uber Analytics Dashboard 
*“Transforming ride-hailing data into actionable mobility insights.”* 📊🚗  

The **Uber BI Dashboard** is an **advanced Power BI analytics project** designed to analyze **ride behavior, customer patterns, cancellations, route performance, distance metrics, and revenue efficiency** for a ride-hailing platform like Uber.  

This dashboard enables stakeholders to make **data-driven decisions** by understanding **where demand comes from, why rides fail, how customers behave, and which routes drive business value**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  

Ride-hailing platforms operate at massive scale with **millions of rides, customers, vehicles, and locations**.  
Key business challenges include:

- Understanding ride demand across locations and time  
- Identifying high cancellation zones and reasons  
- Analyzing customer retention and ride frequency  
- Measuring route-level distance and revenue contribution  
- Optimizing vehicle utilization and operational efficiency  

> ❓ *How can decision-makers quickly analyze rider behavior, route performance, and operational efficiency in one place?*  
> ✅ *Through a centralized Power BI analytics dashboard.*

This project converts raw Uber ride data into **meaningful KPIs, trends, and insights**.
